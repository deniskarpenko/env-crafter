## 🚀 Why Env Crafter?

Spinning up dev environments with Docker should be fast and painless. Whether you're a junior developer or a seasoned engineer, `docker-compose` can be repetitive, hard to maintain, or error-prone. **Env Crafter** solves that by giving you:

- A clean **visual interface** to add and configure services (PHP, PostgreSQL, Redis, Node.js, etc).
- Smart generation of production-ready `docker-compose.yaml` files.
- Cross-platform support (Windows, macOS, Linux).
- Future integrations: LLM-based assistant, pro templates, stack sharing.
